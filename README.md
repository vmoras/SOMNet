# SOMNet
Self Organizing Maps or Kohenin's maps is a neural network used 
mainly for dimension reduction and visualization of data. It can also be used
for clustering and compression. It is also usefully when output data is not available 
or is in a smaller size than the input.

Still working on the program.
